A node group is a collection of managed nodes. Managed nodes are WebSphereÂ® Application Server nodes. A node group defines a boundary for server cluster formation.

## Examples

```sql
select
  name,
  node_group_arn,

  version,
  release_version,
  status,
  region
from
  aws_eks_node_group;
```


### List the subnets associated with node group

```sql
select
  name,
  jsonb_array_elements_text(subnets) as subnets
from
  aws_eks_node_group;
```


### List of remote access configuration that is associated with the node group

  scaling_config -> 'DesiredSize' as desired_size,
  scaling_config -> 'MaxSize' as max_size,
  scaling_config -> 'MinSize' as min_size
from
  aws_eks_node_group;
```

```sql
select
  name,
  h ->> 'Code' as code,
  h ->> 'Message' as max_size,
  h -> 'ResourceIds' as resource_ids
